These are the criteria for inclusion into the COSA directory. The COSA board evaluates each
project against these criteria, then votes on whether or not the project should be included in the
directory. The criteria are based on the Open Source Initiative 10 criteria for defining open
source (https://opensource.org/osd).


### 1 Project Minimum 

The project has a minimum definition including a named leader with contact information, a public repository, a license, and a README file. The license and README must be available in English.

Source code must be available in the repository once the project has a release available for distribution. Deliberately obfuscated source code is not allowed. Intermediate forms such as the output of a preprocessor or translator are not allowed.

### 2 Must Apply to the CDISC Standards

The software must use or in some way support the creation, review, understanding, implementation, or conformance checking of CDISC standards.

### 3 Meets Ethics and COI Requirements

The project team meets the ethics and conflict of interest (COI) requirements as documented in CDISC Policy 001.

### 4 Approved Open-source License

The project uses an existing open-source license approved by the Open Source Initiative. For example, commonly used open-source licenses that meet these criteria include, MIT; Apache-2.0; BSD- 3 - Clause; and the GNU licenses GPL-3.0, AGPL-3.0, LGPL-3.0. If the project uses one of these commonly used and approved open-source licenses, then remaining criteria do not need to be evaluated.

### 5 Free Distribution 

The license shall not restrict any party from selling or giving away the software as a component of an aggregate software distribution containing programs from several different sources. The license shall not require a royalty or other fee for such sale.

### 6 Derived Works 

The license must allow modifications and derived works, and must allow them to be distributed under the same terms as the license of the original software.

### 7 Integrity of The Author's Source Code

The license may restrict source-code from being distributed in modified form only if the license allows the distribution of "patch files" with the source code for the purpose of modifying the program at build time. The license must explicitly permit distribution of software built from modified source code. The license may require derived works to carry a different name or version number from the original software.

### 8 No Discrimination Against Persons or Groups

The license must not discriminate against any person or group of persons.

### 9 No Discrimination Against Fields of Endeavor

The license must not restrict anyone from making use of the program in a specific field of endeavor. For example, it may not restrict the program from being used in a business, or from being used for genetic research.

### 10 Distribution of License

The rights attached to the program must apply to all to whom the program is redistributed without the need for execution of an additional license by those parties.

### 11 License Must Not Be Specific to a Product

The rights attached to the program must not depend on the program's being part of a particular software distribution. If the program is extracted from that distribution and used or distributed within the terms of the program's license, all parties to whom the program is redistributed should have the same rights as those that are granted in conjunction with the original software distribution.

### 12 License Must Not Restrict Other Software

The license must not place restrictions on other software that is distributed along with the licensed software. For example, the license
must not insist that all other programs distributed on the same medium must be open-source software.

### 13 License Must Be Technology-Neutral

No provision of the license may be predicated on any individual technology or style of interface.
