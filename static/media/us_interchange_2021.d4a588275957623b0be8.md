The Virtual CDISC US Interchange has a fantastic slate of speakers this year, including representatives from EMA, PMDA, and FDA CBER, CDER, CDRH and CTP. This is also an opportunity to meet and hear from Dave Evans, the new CDISC President and CEO. Join us to hear about his plans to take CDISC forward as we quickly move toward a more technology-based standards future and cultivate deeper relationships with stakeholders throughout the clinical research ecosystem. We will have presentations on new initiatives – the CDISC Open Rules Engine (CORE), TransCelerate Digital Data Flow Project (DDF), and the CDISC Open Source Alliance (COSA), as well as updates and use cases on the CDISC Foundational Standards, submissions and much more!
