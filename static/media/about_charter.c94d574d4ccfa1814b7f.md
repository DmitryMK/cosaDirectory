CDISC Open Source Alliance (COSA)

### Mission

The CDISC Open Source Alliance supports, promotes, and sometimes sponsors open source and free software development projects that create tools for implementing or developing CDISC standards to drive innovation in the CDISC community.


### Scope 

* **Supports** open source software development projects through collaboration between development teams, including CDISC development teams, to exchange information, provide input or feedback, create best practices, coordinate dependencies between projects, provide input into standards development, request CDISC Library features, and develop common APIs. Supports open source software that implements the CDISC Library API, CDISC 360 metadata, and the CDISC Data Exchange Standards. Seeks to accelerate the development and adoption of open source software solutions. Helps to drive the development of innovative new approaches to standards-based automation.
* **Promotes** open source software developers by providing support for community development, venues for presenting to CDISC members such as Interchanges or webinars, CDISC infrastructure, as well as other marketing opportunities. Promotes the development and adoption automated approaches to implementing CDISC standards. Promotes technical innovation within the CDISC community.
* **Sponsors** specific projects important to the CDISC initiatives by providing developer, infrastructure, and project management resources.

### CDISC Strategy Line of Sight

* I.A.3. Support use of CDISC Library API by open source, open access developers including hackathons, webinars, and other exposure of tools to the community.
* I.B.2. Develop tools to facilitate moving content in to and out of the CDISC Library. Develop tools to facilitate community members utilizing CDISC Library content.
* II.B.2. Promulgate at least five new open-source, open-access tools for academic researchers built from the CDISC Library API.
* III.A.1. In light of CDISC 360 results, consider the structure of all teams to facilitate collaborative creation of metadata and of tools.
