# Open Source

Open source complements open standards. Embedding standards-driven automation capabilities into open-source software will accelerate innovation in the CDISC community. While new for many in the CDISC commuity, open-source software is driving innovation across a number of industry sectors, including healthcare, and McKinsey & Company research notes that open-source adoption is the biggest differentiator for top performing organizations. COSA seeks to accelerate the development and adoption of open-source software used to implement or create the CDISC standards.
